Calculus (from Latin calculus, literally 'small pebble', used for counting and calculations, as on an abacus) is the mathematical study of continuous change, in the same way that geometry is the study of shape and algebra is the study of generalizations of arithmetic operations.

Derivatives
-----------

A derivative is the slope of a function. It is not necessarily a constant.

### Computation graph

A computation graph shows us in what order we must compute our derivatives to get the derivative of a desired variable. It can be computed using the chain rule.

Chain rule for determining J's derivative with respect to a: $\\frac{dJ}{da} = \\frac{dJ}{dv} \\cdot \\frac{dv}{da}.$
