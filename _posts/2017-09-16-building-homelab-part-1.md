Some of you may have heard of <https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/>. Some people there have amazing builds. As such, considering that I have some hardware laying around and that we are changing the furniture downstairs, I decided to use what pieces of furniture I can to create my own homelab.

## What is a homelab?

Basically, it’s a network of computers you use to study? What you may ask? Anything, from web hosting and security to networking. If you want more details, head here: [introduction – homelab](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/wiki/introduction).

Furniture used:

  * Top part of a wooden library (80 x 30 x 150 <cm> w x d x h – not taking into account the top cover)
  * Left shelves of a wooden library (35 x 28 x 115 <cm> w x d x h)
  * Wooden desk (70 x 60 x 75 <cm> w x d x h)
  * Wood shelves (40 x 30 x 117 <cm> w x d x h)

Software used:

  * [SketchUp Make](https://www.sketchup.com/download)

Note: This series of posts will mostly be a build log, not necessarily a tutorial.

## 1. The furniture

## 2. Planning

In order to be able to effectively make use of all the space, I decided to create a 3D model of the homelab in [SketchUp Make](https://www.sketchup.com/download). I took a tape measure an after about 1 hour my work was complete.

<div class="rl-gallery-container" id="rl-gallery-container-9" data-gallery_id="0"> <div class="rl-gallery rl-basicgrid-gallery " id="rl-gallery-9" data-gallery_no="9"> 

<div class="rl-gallery-item">
  <a href="https://tzeny.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/sketch_1.jpg" title="Front view" data-rl_title="Front view" class="rl-gallery-link" data-rl_caption="" data-rel="lightbox-gallery-9">![My helpful screenshot](/assets/img/posts/2017/09/sketch_1-236x300.jpg)<span class="rl-gallery-caption"><span class="rl-gallery-item-title">Front view</span></span></a>
</div>

<div class="rl-gallery-item">
  <a href="https://tzeny.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/sketch_2.jpg" title="Top right corner view" data-rl_title="Top right corner view" class="rl-gallery-link" data-rl_caption="" data-rel="lightbox-gallery-9">![My helpful screenshot](/assets/img/posts/2017/09/sketch_2-209x300.jpg)<span class="rl-gallery-caption"><span class="rl-gallery-item-title">Top right corner view</span></span></a>
</div></div> </div>

This might change as I make modifications to the homelab, but this is the baseline.

## 3. Future

In the next part me and my father will strengthen the homelab using L joints, and I will be deciding on where to place the components.
