An interesting short story written by Isaac Asimov that later became a novel. It explores what would happen to the people living on a planet that is exposed to starlight only once every 2049 years.

Asimov describes the solar system in the novel and short story just enough to make it seem plausible. 

This inspired 2 researchers in India to write a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="paper (opens in a new tab)" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.4895.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> exploring the possibility of this hypothetical system’s existence; they concluded that it was plausible for the system to exist for at least a couple hundred years. 

More research is necessary, using modern solar system simulation techniques.
