# December 2019 - end of January 2019 - Getting a taste of what's out there

So, how did this start? In december 2019 I realized just how exciting photography could be; soon after I got my second hand Sony NEX 5T I felt I wanted to get into astrophotography. And I started by taking pictures of the moon with an old Tokina SZ-X 70-300mm telephoto lens combined with a Yashica 2x teleconverter. That was nice, and I got some ok shots. 

Although the kit lens isn't much too good for Solar System or deep sky objects, it can be pretty good for capturing wide field nature shots including the stars. The sky is trully full of stars, and wonder, and hope, and darkness. And looking up at it is, is really beautiful, and humbling. It makes our ego drain away, leaving but our soul standing there, gazing.

# End of April - Stepping up: BlackDiamond N 150/750 Explorer mounted on a NEQ-3 mount, with RA and DEC motors

I tried to find deep sky objects using my flimsy camera tripod (which I got as a gift from a family friend, proving invaluable for normal photography), but failed miserably. It was incredibly shake, especially using the Tokina telephoto lens. 

So, I started looking online to buy a second hand telescope mount. After a couple of days, I struck gold. And in much larger quantities than expected. I wrote to a guy selling a telescope mount, but he didn't answer, so I kept looking. And I found a fully fledged telescope, with a motorized mount for 375 EUR (410 USD). It was a very sweet deal, and I called him telling him I was interested. I asked an astronomer friend if the scope seemed ok, and he said yes. Next came a very intense couple of hours, in which the seller did not respond to my confirmation of his offer as he was busy with work. But in the evening he confirmed the price. And he also offered me a smaller refractor as a bonus (he was selling it for 20 EUR (22 USD)).

This all happened on a Wednesday. He asked if I was ok with receiving the package after the weekend, and I said sure. He used this time to package it nicely. Unfortunately due to a misunderstanding with the courier he only managed to ship it out on Tuesday. 

It arrived at my house on Wednesday, and after careful inspection and assembly everything seemed ok, except for a missing screw for the DEC motor gear. And finally, I was greeted with this wonderful sight:
