In order to heat my van I decided on buying a Propex HS2000 (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.propexheatsource.co.uk/heaters/hs2000" target="_blank">https://www.propexheatsource.co.uk/heaters/hs2000</a>) heater. It is efficient, consuming on average only 142 grams of gas / hour and it can run on LPG, which is quite common in Romania and in Europe in general.

**Tip:** if you’re looking for LPG always use Waze or websites like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.mylpg.eu/stations/" target="_blank">https://www.mylpg.eu/stations/</a> to determine the best prices

Here are a couple of pictures of the most important bits: the heater itself and the digital thermostat

## Buying one

Ordering it directly from the manufacturer’s website would have cost £540 + £50.00 (shipping) = **£590**. 

The best deal I could find was on the JustKampers website: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.justkampers.com/hs2000-propex-heatsource-hs2000-12v-lpg-gas-heater-fitting-kit-digital-thermostat.html" target="_blank">https://www.justkampers.com/hs2000-propex-heatsource-hs2000-12v-lpg-gas-heater-fitting-kit-digital-thermostat.html</a>; this cost £529.00 + £21.75 (shipping) = **£550.76.** A saving of ~£40 and it also included a fitting kit, which I thought would be useful.
