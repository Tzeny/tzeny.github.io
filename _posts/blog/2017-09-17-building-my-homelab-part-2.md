After bringing all pieces of furniture in the same place, we had to bolt them together. Afterwards, I also added LED lights to make working on the hardware easier. In the future I plan to make the lighting on each shelf individually controllable, that’s why all the LED strips have separate connectors.

**Part 1:** [Building my Homelab – part 1](https://tzeny.com/2017/09/16/building-homelab-part-1/)

Parts used:

  * ~ 5m of LED lighting strips, warm light
  * furniture screws

Software used:

  * [SketchUp Make](https://www.sketchup.com/download)
